"I do well, thanks for asking. ",Speaker Responsive
"Yeah, I'm, I'm recently married. And so my husband and I moved in together. And up until then I I've lived by myself. My whole adult life. So apparently the craziest things have been happening. While I've been sleeping. several, several nights I've woken him up screaming. I'm screaming. Apparently a very vulgar, profane, profane the words and So that's a little alarming to him. And I've even, you know, we've been hitting him in the middle of the night. You know, he's waking up with these huge bruises on his arms. And so yeah, apparently, a behavior in the middle of the night is out of hand.",Speaker Initiative
"Yes. Um, I participated in a sleep study and what they say they rolled out some some other things and thought that maybe it was a behavior, Sleep Disorder. So they have referred me to you, I'm still working with them. Now. They're still running some tests and everything but they thought maybe there are some other stressors or underlying things, so",Speaker Initiative
"Colby? Um, well, I'm just little worried that it's going to affect my marriage and that my husband will not be able to deal with that. So I would just really like to figure out how to keep my relationship with Him successful with it. So overcome these issues.",Speaker Initiative
"Usually I wake up and he's like, what are you doing? I was having the worst dream. So those dreams are kind of what he's telling me are aligning. What my behavior is, my dreams are aligning with those. So you know, I don't feel anything. It doesn't feel like I've been anything. I have. I've met a couple times and woken up, but no people do that. So I didn't really think anything of it. But now I'm starting to wonder. Yeah, it's it's a little strange. So Oh, concerning.",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, I mean, I would, I wouldn't have known. I've lived by myself. But you know, I, before I had fallen out of bed a couple times, and, you know, my sheets and pillows are always everywhere when I wake up, but I didn't really think anything of it. So kind of making the connections now.",Speaker Initiative
"after you go to sleep? I'm in the middle of the night he has. He said at first he thought I was joking around But, yeah, no, no, I am waking him up, you know. So",Speaker Initiative
No.,General
"that he's, he's usually around electronic cash snapping he says it hasn't happened and so. Alright.",Speaker Initiative
Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, that would probably be helpful for him to kind of get this side of things too.",Speaker Initiative
"Yes, yes.",General
yeah.,Speaker Initiative
No.,Speaker Initiative
They're not married.,Speaker Initiative
Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
I was about 16.,Speaker Initiative
I think it was about 18.,Speaker Initiative
"Well, yeah, I mean, it was pretty much right after they got divorced. She married some guy. I don't even know he was nice guy, but it was like six months after pretty much like real fast. Um, and then that didn't last very long. Forgive me, I have to remember like how long they were together because there's so many. But I believe that they were only together for not even a year. And then she kind of had some time where she just was dating But it was numerous people. And then she met somebody in her a meeting. And they married. That lasted, that they probably got married.",Speaker Initiative
Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
"Yes, that's a third and then this one would be Oh, yeah, the fourth the fourth. Okay.",Speaker Initiative
"No, no. Now she's, I don't know, just dating or whatever she was",Speaker Initiative
was three years that was the longest.,Speaker Initiative
"Um, it's good, I guess. I mean,",Speaker Initiative
"Um, it's just it's honestly there's no other way to describe it. It's just chaotic. I mean, she's chaotic. So she's all over the place and it's just Hard to capture on a good day. And when you do, it's just you know, it's kind of surface our relationship.",Speaker Initiative
"My parents raised me? Yeah, yeah. I mean, they were good parents, I guess, according to my standards, because my mom was just always a mess. So I guess they both did the best that they could, given some circumstances. So",Speaker Initiative
"um, I think so. Yeah, definitely.",Speaker Initiative
"yeah, absolutely. ",Speaker Initiative
I do. I do. I have two siblings. Okay.,Speaker Initiative
"Um, it's okay. You know, I guess. I mean,",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah. I don't really see them quite honestly. So If I do see them and maybe it's like if I show up at a at a family party once every five years, but so I think to me, that's okay. That's right. Yeah.",Speaker Initiative
"I think so. I mean, you know, it's not my fault that they won't accept who I am.",Speaker Initiative
"like heart disease or anything like back in the medical? My grandpa had like heart disease. My grandfather had cancer but he beat colon cancer was in like the first stage but he was fine after. But as far as my parents, they don't have any medical issues that I know of.",Speaker Initiative
I'm just crazy. Like my mom was crazy and she was just completely,Speaker Initiative
"she uses magnetic like I guess like bipolar, but we she never really got like a definitive label as dipole bipolar and like therapy or anything like that. But",Speaker Initiative
"No, that's just my mom with her. You know obsessiveness and she'd get depressed after But as far as any other siblings No, no.",Speaker Initiative
"I mean, we would go on family vacations. When I was a kid. We were constantly staying at the best hotels and stuff like that. Because a mom, you know, would shop around, she actually would Book Three hotels, and just decide which one she liked better when we got there. I don't, I don't know. But anyway, we would do that we would go on vacations together, we would always go down to the beach. So that was really our family tradition as far as in like holidays. We did when we were younger. We would have like our family over for Christmas and stuff like that. But",Speaker Initiative
"I Christmas was yester During the most important Thanksgiving, ",Speaker Initiative
"Sometimes we would go to my cousin's house on my dad's side, and Christmas would be at my parents house and then Easter woods. It was just very back back and forth between my cousins or my parents, whoever wanted to happen.",Speaker Initiative
"my extended family? Well, on my dad's side, my uncle, he's super successful. And he's a cool guy, you know, I don't really see him now. But when I was a kid, I did. But now I don't see him at all. Honestly, I don't really see anybody at all. But um, yeah, and on my mom's side, she has a sister. And she's like crazy, but she's not as crazy as my mom. But she has she has two kids. And she's actually still married to her to her husband. They were actually highschool sweethearts, so I don't have where my mom came from but and I hadn't seen her probably since I graduated high school. And, you know, she associates my mom and they talk amongst themselves so I don't really have a relationship with her either. So",Speaker Initiative
"Well, yeah, there's not many now.",Speaker Initiative
"Um, my mom would drink sometimes when I was growing up, but that's what my mom is really friendly to me when she would drink And yeah, she would drink. I don't know if that's, you know, she was considered an alcoholic but she would drink often. And I think just to come off of her shopping a lot she would drink or vice versa. Sometimes she would drink or shopping or just to calm down, she would drink and sometimes in our drinking habits, she would actually be nice to me.",Speaker Initiative
"Yes, it's really hard. So like when I'm in the middle of being worried, I'm it's really hard for me to focus. So I can't focus on like what I need to do. Because I feel like my mind is on a lot of different things and I can't focus on you know exactly what I should be doing. It's just like, I'm worried about You know, all the different aspects.",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, it's like focus my energy on the right things. I'm just like wasting time worrying.",Speaker Initiative
Yeah. And then like while I'm presenting,Speaker Initiative
Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
Yeah,Speaker Initiative
"It depends on the presentation. Sometimes there's like one or two other people that have to present that night, depending on like how long the topic is.",Speaker Initiative
"Well, the one that I really messed up, I think in that I was first But usually, like, I'm like, second maybe.",Speaker Initiative
"I feel like I am totally zoned out. Like I'm not even paying attention to what that person saying, because I'm so worried about how I'm gonna mess it up. You know, I'm, I'm starting to like be sweaty, like my hands are clammy, my heart started to race a little bit, and I'm just totally zoned out on what they're doing. Just, you know, worrying about what's gonna happen when I get up there.",Speaker Responsive
Yes. It's funny you should say that was a little bit hesitant to mention that but I kind of I do I feel like I need to find excuse to like use the bathroom or I just need to get out of there.,Speaker Initiative
"Um,",Speaker Initiative
"I think I'm thinking, like, I'm gonna bomb this anyway. So I might as well just, you know, not go through the stress of having to do it. Like I've already in my head, I know that it's going to end badly.",Speaker Initiative
"right. So there's no sense in getting up there. And maybe if I don't get up there, you know, I guess it couldn't be any worse. So I might as well just leave",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, I don't want I figure if I leave and people won't, will just make me think I was sick or whatever. And it'll be a better situation, if I just left then happened to see me up there, you know, sweating and all these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up there, it would be better just to leave before that starts.",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody, you know,",Speaker Initiative
Right.,Speaker Initiative
"right. And I'm looking at the clock and saying, you know, like, how much more time in this presentation before I have to go like, should I go? Should I not go? What are the consequences of running out? You know, and kind of playing out, which would be worse?",Speaker Initiative
"Um, once I went to the bathroom to try to, like calm myself down or talk to myself, or you know, like, Cool off my face. Um, but I came back",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, I almost felt like I was gonna be ill. I was so stressed that day.",Speaker Initiative
"So typically, like, I go to load my presentation, at this point, like, I have my new cards or whatever, in front of me. I am like, shaking at this point. I am so I don't know if it's scared, or worried or maybe a combination of everything. And I'm just like sweating. My heart is racing. Like I almost feel dizzy. I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen. And then you know, I'm starting to speak. And then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so. Okay, so I have to stay up there for the duration and I'm just like, you know, sweating and then I'm wondering like, are people looking at me or people? Can people see it? You know, am I going to forget something?",Speaker Initiative
"right. Or they think I've been lazy and I didn't prepare, are they going to think that, you know, I'm dumb or I don't know, you know what I'm doing.",Speaker Initiative
Right. Or like be judging me. Okay.,Speaker Responsive
"Um, it's depends sometimes I settled down a little bit, but then usually like that, I get some sort of rhythm I think. And then, but then it gets anxiety again until I get my grades. Do you know what I mean? And I'm like, until, because I feel like I'm gonna do poorly. Until that happens when",Speaker Initiative
"Sometimes, like she usually doesn't give them that day but like often like the next day or the day after",Speaker Initiative
now? It definitely like dissipates once I can like go sit down.,Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, when eyes are maybe no longer on me. They've moved on to somebody else. So I figured like, okay, they forgot about me. I'm safe.",Speaker Initiative
And I convince myself that I did poorly.,Speaker Initiative
Okay.,Speaker Initiative
"Well, I mean, I'm, I'm curious about them because I haven't been very well, right. I haven't been very, very well. I've been last week I threw up some blood. ",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, the first time. I mean, I threw up blood last weekend then. Again, yesterday. So there's something bad going on. I know there's something bad going ",Speaker Initiative
what cancer right I think I probably have cancer i'm not i'm not doing very well I just look headaches and I was just,Speaker Initiative
"It was a it was almost filling a toilet wasn't that much. I wasn't like that it was enough that I could see it in the toilet, and I was throwing up.",Speaker Initiative
"Well, I was feeling sick. So and I had headaches and I, you know, I've got,",Speaker Initiative
I have headaches a lot,Speaker Initiative
"that was in the morning and then again,",General
"the other time it was sort of later in the day, but I",General
"you know, I also wake up in the middle of the night and I'm just covered in sweat. I know that's another cancer thing.",General
"Actually, just before I came here,",Speaker Initiative
"I had orange juice and I had some vodka in it. It's the only thing actually that like steadies me enough to get out the door. I don't ever go out that often. But right now,",Speaker Initiative
"It's just studies me studies me like I'm, you know, I'm shaking all the time. I'm just like,",Speaker Initiative
"Five? Hmm, maybe",Speaker Initiative
I don't measure,General
"Sometimes if I'm feeling really like my stomach is really upset, I'll drink cider. So that's its cider or vodka because",Speaker Initiative
In the last week? Not so much in the last couple of weeks maybe?,Speaker Responsive
"I don't know. Actually. I mean, I don't know. I've got you know, I've got a lot going on. Right. Yeah. So my, my sister is in Boston, she's got cancer and I know like I should be calling her and I can't do that. My mom is really sick and she's horrible, and I'm the only one that Who can go see her? And I go see my mother and she just yells and screams at me and she's got this email and it's just",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, yeah.",Speaker Initiative
"I guess. I mean, I, you know, my days don't differ that much. But I, you know, I'll fall asleep in front of television and then I'm not seeing lots of people so I you know, there's not big events in my life that I would be remembering. I just, you know, especially now that I'm feeling so not well, that I",Speaker Initiative
"yeah, there's not much that I would have to remember",Speaker Initiative
I did. I did.,Speaker Initiative
"You know, I had a boyfriend who",Speaker Initiative
"you know, was Sort of casual coming over and, and he, he basically said he couldn't be with me anymore because I drink too much. And so I tried. I tried. I was like, Well, yeah, and then he left. So who cares, right? I mean, right?",Speaker Initiative
"I feel guilty about my sister, right? I feel guilty that I can't like I just can't. I can't even call her like I can't.",General
Right. So,General
"if I, if I could pull it together than I could,",General
"Umm I am kind of doing, I'm feeling a little bit stressed out",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, I feel like I have a lot on my plate. I have this test that I have to take for work.",Speaker Initiative
It's like an aptitude test. It has like math problems on it and like scenarios in order for me to move up to the system manager position.,Speaker Initiative
"Yes. Yes. So I've been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually scheduled for me to take the test. And I want and I just got really overwhelmed. And I started like I felt my heart was racing. I felt like I wish my hands were shaking. And I just really couldn't concentrate on the test. Even though the night before me and my friend that practice problems, and I knew all the answers with no proper like, I didn't miss any of the questions",Speaker Initiative
yes.,General
"No, I wasn't able to complete it. And thankfully, they gave me a chance to come back. I just told him I didn't feel well. So they rescheduled so now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety because I'm scared the same thing is gonna happe, when I go back.",Speaker Initiative
"Today, the night before, I felt like I know all the answers, but the minute I walked into the room, all of a sudden, all these fears kind of took over. ",Speaker Initiative
"Yes, ",Speaker Initiative
Yes.,Speaker Initiative
"Yes, ",General
"I had some anxiety the day before. But when I reviewed it with my friend, I'm like, Oh, I know the answers. I thought that would kind of push it down. But I think once I got there, it all came back up to the surface,",General
"Well, I've always kind of struggled with tests. I'm like, I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test, because I was really struggling in math. And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade. And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it, I had a tutor, and I felt really prepared for it. And then when I took it, I failed. And I was held back. And I feel like, you know, that was so it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. And I felt like I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time. Because I felt like I really didn't know this. I don't know why I couldn't pass the test.",General
Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
"Yes, I always feel really anxious. I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from college. School went on to high school. But it's so hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I know it, I may still fail the test anyway, maybe like a repeat of what happened.",Speaker Initiative
no,Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, I mean, sometimes I get an A. ",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is good. Yeah, it's good.",General
Yes.,General
"I think it's just the fact that it's this promotion. So it's like the same thing. Like, if I fail, I'm being held back. And I feel like it's, we live in that moment of being held back. And that, that that's like a fear that I have that, um, that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back.",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, I mean, I didn't put them together until now. But yeah.",General
"Now because they didn't have all that pressure that it was either win win or lose, basically, ",Speaker Initiative
or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn't do good on that.,Speaker Initiative
"Yes. Was it fail, you know, pass or fail?",General
"Yeah, if I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion, I would have to wait. Just like I did not have to wait a certain amount of time. I think an ear before I could take it again.",Speaker Initiative
Yeah it is,Speaker Initiative
"Um, no, there isn't.",Speaker Initiative
No,Speaker Initiative
"Yes, it is. ",General
Yeah.,General
Yes.,General
"that  I could fail that if I fail I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the things that I try",Speaker Initiative
I would say like I'm destined to be.,General
"I mean, that's what scares me. That's, that's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test. And if I don't pass that, it's just gonna have like this domino effect of failure.",General
Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, my hands shaking. ",Speaker Initiative
"Yes, ",General
Yeah.,General
"No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get worked out when I'm about to take a test, okay, but it's only around test.",Speaker Initiative
want to actually do take the test?,Speaker Responsive
"Um, I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question.",General
"Yeah, that's true. ",General
and I could also choose like maybe questions that are no the answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stress,General
"yes and then I feel like I know, at least I know that like, Don't validate the feeling that I maybe I can pass this test.",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, definitely. Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that I know these questions are definitely going to be right.",General
"Yeah, that's true. Nobody's there. Nobody's gonna see me. I'm kind of trying to get myself together. ",Speaker Initiative
"Probabiy, I could use like self talk. ",General
"Yeah,",General
"Yeah, I mean, I've done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test. ",Speaker Initiative
"yes, that has worked and I passed. ",General
"Yeah, that's true.",General
"So even if I have to take the test again and in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again. It's not like I'll never be able to take this test again.",General
"No, no, definitely not. And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back. I still managed to, you know, do well the next year and keep moving up. And it hasn't really, in the long run prevented me from doing anything that I've wanted to do.",General
"Yes, I definitely have.",General
"Yeah. I mean, definitely I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I've been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to like that feeling that I'm going to just fail together.",Speaker Initiative
on next week.,General
"Okay, right. ",General
"Okay. Yeah, I mean, that sounds good. That helped me prepare for the test. ",General
"Well, I came to see Dr. Seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety, that's kind of getting the best of me. And in the course of my appointment with him, he was asking how I was dealing with that stress. And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and, and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something.",General
I suppose.,Speaker Initiative
He told me to fill that out and bring it with me.,Speaker Initiative
"typically, yeah. ",Speaker Initiative
"wine with my meals? You know, again, one or two, typically and more frequently, three or four. My stress is increased.",Speaker Responsive
okay,Speaker Initiative
I feel the glass up so maybe a little more than that,Speaker Initiative
"That news to me, you know, I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy. You know, no more than seven in a week? That seems kind of prohibitive?",Speaker Initiative
"Well, you know, it does, at least in the moment, temporarily reduce my stress. And I you know, like a good glass of wine. I don't don't drink the cheap stuff. I like the expensive.",Speaker Initiative
"Um, well, you know, the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kinda yaak and, of course, part of my stress is finances. And I mentioned I like the good stuff. And so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden,",Speaker Responsive
"Yeah, kind of defeating the purpose they're",Speaker Initiative
And maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress. Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
"Well, I've exercised in the past and that helps. Right now. My schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do. That's why I came to see Dr. seal. I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help. You know, when I'm feeling overwhelmed,",Speaker Initiative
"Well, I mean, if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking, then it's fairly important, maybe about seven. ",Speaker Initiative
"Well, again, I got to get things under control. You know, My kids are dependent on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress. And so, you know, all those responsibilities",Speaker Initiative
"Well, the you know, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can't afford to, you know, have any more stress.  So, yeah, ",Speaker Initiative
hmmm,Speaker Initiative
"I'm pretty confident and you know, probably about a seven or an eight ",Speaker Initiative
"I you know, I like a lot A glass of wine, I don't want to quit altogether, I'd be willing to try cutting that. But now if it's going to, if Dr. Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time.",Speaker Initiative
"Well, again, you know, if if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress, then then you know, I be pretty ready. Again, maybe about an on that scale, maybe an eight.",Speaker Initiative
"Oh, I you know that the exercise but again, that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now. I'm hoping that Dr. Seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of ",Speaker Responsive
That would be nice,Speaker Responsive
Okay,General
"Yeah, I've been feeling really low and I think I might be depressed. ",Speaker Initiative
I mean,Speaker Initiative
"years ago I you know, felt had some of these similar things. But I didn't really think about it much and I mean, it's gone on for like, I've been feeling this way for like a month. And, you know, I I think something's wrong.",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah,",Speaker Initiative
Yeah. I haven't been able to sleep.,Speaker Initiative
This has been going on for a month.,Speaker Initiative

"I haven't really thought about it. But I mean, I still have fun sometimes.",Speaker Initiative
I just noticed that most of my,Speaker Initiative
"No, I mean, I still try, you know, you know, to distract myself. Like if I noticed that I'm like, just feeling really low and or like, even if I can't sleep At night, like I'll do go do something that I like doing. You know how to pass the time?",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, I mean, I haven't really been eating that much. And I've actually lost a few pounds. Yes, three pounds. Yeah.",Speaker Initiative
"Correct. It's really hard for me to fall asleep. And sometimes I'll just lie there for hours at night and it's, you know, awful focused, and I'm tired all day, because I didn't sleep at night. And when I get home and it's time for bed again, I still can't fall asleep.",Speaker Initiative
Yeah.,Speaker Initiative
"No, not really like that",Speaker Initiative
No.,Speaker Initiative
"no, I mean, like not really no, like, I don't feel worthless. I just you know, I just I'm still sad. I don't know why I'm sad. ",Speaker Initiative
"Yeah, it's it's hard to concentrate at work and, and in general even at home because I just am so tired. not sleeping and tonight I just get distracted by like, you know, like, I'll be over, come with emotion and I out of nowhere, like it's hard for me to pay attention to what I'm doing. If I'm getting distracted by those thoughts.",Speaker Initiative
Nothing like that. No.,Speaker Initiative
